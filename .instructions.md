# GitHub Copilot Instructions for AI BAST Agents Library

## Project Overview

This is the AI BAST (Business Applications Solution Technologies) Specialist Team AI Agents Library - a Microsoft framework for building and deploying AI agent automation capabilities integrated with Microsoft 365, Teams, and Copilot Studio.

The framework implements the **Rapid Agent Prototype Pattern (RAPP)** - a 14-step process from customer discovery through production deployment, with a focus on rapid MVP validation and iterative customer feedback.

## Repository Structure

- `index.html` - Primary comprehensive framework documentation (production guide)
- `README.md` - Repository overview and quick start guide
- `CLAUDE.md` - Instructions for Claude Code AI assistant
- `tools/` - HTML-based tools and utilities for the framework
- `LICENSE` - MIT License (Copyright 2025 Microsoft)

## Key Architecture Concepts

The system uses a three-layer architecture:

1. **Orchestration Layer**: Copilot Studio + Power Automate for routing and UI
2. **Intelligence Layer**: Stateless Azure Function App (~500 lines) that dynamically loads agents
3. **Memory Layer**: Azure File Storage for agent code and user context storage

**Key Design Principles**:
- Agents are hot-loaded from Azure File Storage (`memory/{user-guid}/agents/`) - no redeployment needed for updates
- Stateless function design enables infinite horizontal scaling
- Universal memory allows context persistence across Teams, Web, Mobile interfaces
- Memory stored by `user_guid`, not by interface

## Development Guidelines

### Documentation

- The primary documentation is in `index.html` - it's a comprehensive production guide that serves as both technical documentation and client-facing material
- Keep documentation consistent across `index.html`, `README.md`, and `CLAUDE.md`
- When updating documentation, ensure all three files stay aligned with the same core concepts and architecture

### Agent Development

Agents referenced in the documentation are Python files that are:
- Self-documenting and modular
- Stored in Azure File Storage and dynamically loaded
- Designed to work across multiple interfaces (Teams, web, mobile, voice)
- Following a template pattern for consistency with the framework's dynamic loading system

### HTML Tools

- Tools in the `tools/` directory are standalone HTML files
- These tools should work without external dependencies when possible
- Maintain consistency with the framework's design principles

### Testing and Validation

This is primarily a documentation repository with no build process or automated tests. When making changes:
- Validate HTML syntax for any HTML file changes
- Ensure documentation accuracy and consistency
- Test HTML tools manually in a browser
- Verify all links and references are correct

### Code Style

- Follow Microsoft's documentation standards
- Use clear, professional language appropriate for enterprise customers
- Maintain consistency with existing file formatting and structure
- Keep the MIT License header intact (Copyright 2025 Microsoft)

## Important Notes

- This repository does not have Python code directly - it documents a framework where Python agents are stored in Azure File Storage
- No build process, package manager, or test suite is required
- Focus on documentation quality, accuracy, and consistency
- All changes should maintain alignment with the RAPP (Rapid Agent Prototype Pattern) methodology
