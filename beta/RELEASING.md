# Releasing RAPP Brainstem Frontier

RAPP Brainstem Frontier follows Skill Recorder's source-only release pattern:

1. Publish an immutable annotated tag after the staging commit passes.
2. Record the full release commit and installer hashes in the GitHub Release.
3. Do not attach locally assembled Electron applications to the source release.
4. Test the installer against the exact commit from a clean isolated home.

## 1. Prepare and validate

Update `VERSION`, `package.json`, and `package-lock.json` to the same semantic
prerelease version, then run:

```sh
npm ci --no-audit --no-fund
npm run check
npm test
```

Wait for the repository preflight workflow on the release commit to pass.

Binary packaging is optional and is not required for a source-only release. If
you intentionally prepare a macOS preview artifact, run `npm run dist:mac` and
review it separately. Do not attach a locally assembled application to the
source-only GitHub Release.

## 2. Create the immutable tag

Use a component-qualified tag because this repository ships more than one
versioned product:

```sh
version="0.1.0-beta.1"
release_commit="<full-40-character-commit>"
tag="brainstem-beta-v$version"
git tag -a "$tag" "$release_commit" -m "RAPP Brainstem Frontier v$version"
git push upstream "$tag"
```

Never move or reuse a published tag. Publish a new prerelease version instead.

## 3. Calculate installer hashes

Calculate hashes from the exact release commit's Git blobs:

```sh
node -e 'const {execFileSync}=require("node:child_process");const {createHash}=require("node:crypto");const commit=process.argv[1];if(!/^[0-9a-f]{40}$/i.test(commit))throw new Error("full release commit SHA required");for(const file of ["beta/install.cmd","beta/install.sh"]){const data=execFileSync("git",["cat-file","blob",commit+":"+file]);console.log(createHash("sha256").update(data).digest("hex")+"  "+file)}' "$release_commit"
```

## 4. Publish the source-only prerelease

Release notes must include:

- the version and full release commit;
- SHA-256 values for `beta/install.cmd` and `beta/install.sh`;
- user-visible changes and known beta limitations;
- commit-pinned Windows and macOS/Linux install commands;
- a clear statement that the release is source-only.

Publish after preparing a temporary notes file outside the repository:

```sh
gh release create "$tag" \
  --repo microsoft/aibast-agents-library \
  --verify-tag \
  --prerelease \
  --title "RAPP Brainstem Frontier v$version" \
  --notes-file "<release-notes-file>"
```

## 5. Test the published commit

Use a clean temporary `HOME` and disable launch during installation:

```sh
repo="microsoft/aibast-agents-library"
commit="<full-40-character-commit>"
curl -fsSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/$repo/$commit/beta/install.sh" \
  | HOME="<isolated-home>" \
    BRAINSTEM_BETA_HOME="<isolated-home>/.brainstem/beta-launcher" \
    BRAINSTEM_BETA_REPO_URL="https://github.com/$repo.git" \
    BRAINSTEM_BETA_COMMIT="$commit" \
    BRAINSTEM_BETA_NO_LAUNCH=1 bash
```

Confirm the launcher checkout and the shared Brainstem checkout both resolve to
the release commit, then launch the installed Electron application and verify
the Brainstem health endpoint.
